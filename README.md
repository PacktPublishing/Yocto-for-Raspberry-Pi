##Instructions and Navigation

The code included with this book is meant for use as an aid in performing the exercises and should not be used as a replacement for the book itself.
Used out of context, the code may result in an unusable configuration and no warranty is given.

The code will look like the following:
```
# LAYER_CONF_VERSION is increased each time build/conf/bblayers.conf
# changes incompatibly
LCONF_VERSION = "6" BBPATH = "${TOPDIR}" BBFILES ?= "" BBLAYERS ?= " \
/home/packt/RASPBERRYPI/poky/meta \
/home/packt/RASPBERRYPI/poky/meta-yocto \
/home/packt/RASPBERRYPI/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
"BBLAYERS_NON_REMOVABLE ?= " \
/home/packt/RASPBERRYPI/poky/meta \
